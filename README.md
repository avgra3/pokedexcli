# Pokedex Cli

A simple cli to query the Pokemon API.

## Key Ideas Implemented

- Caching
    - A simple caching mechanism to reduce the amount of API requests we need to send.
- Pointers
    - Allows us to keep track of the same objects that we can update, including the cache and pokedex
- API requests
    - Make requests to API endpoints
    - Handle responses, including errors
